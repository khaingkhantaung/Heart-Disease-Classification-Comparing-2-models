# Heart Disease Classification :Comparing the accuracy of two models
## Overview
### This whole project is developed in Python adn applies two Machine Learning Models: __SVM and Random Forest__
* In this project, I use scikit learn's libraries to perform all steps starting from exploratory data analysis(EDA) to model evaluation.
* Can be run on your __local machine, Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.__

## Goal of the Project
* __To classify heart disease presence using machine learning and compare SVM vs Random Forest models' effectiveness.__

## Dataset
* You can download the dataset for this project via this link:[Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

## Requirements
* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* matplotlib

## About This Project
* This project was created as part of __my learning journey in machine learning__.
* Feedback is welcome! Feel Free to suggest improvements.
